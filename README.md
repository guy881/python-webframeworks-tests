# python-webframeworks-tests

This repository contains benchmarks of popular python webframeworks. 

All the tests are done by a tool for HTTP benchmarking called [wrk](https://github.com/wg/wrk) which is required here.

Those tests are inspired by tests of [japronto](https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto).

The included tests results are very low, because or running frameworks on Raspberry Pi Zero and Raspberry Pi 3.
